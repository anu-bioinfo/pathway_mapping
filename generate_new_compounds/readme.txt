Objective: Iterative pathway mapping and docking to expand ligand database

Method:
(a) Generate new compounds based on reaction chemistry
(b) Generate isomers of new compounds
(c) Draw out 3D structures
(d) Minimize 3D structures and dock

Files:
(1) generate_new_smiles.py 
(2) smiles.txt : input file with smiles string and ligand identifier
